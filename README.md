# Sales Performance Analysis Using SQL and Exploratory Data Techniques

This project explores sales trends across time and geography using structured query language (SQL) and exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques. It focuses on identifying high-revenue regions, understanding seasonal demand patterns, and evaluating performance over multiple years to inform strategic business decisions.

## Project File

- `sales-performance-sql-eda-analysis.pdf` – Detailed report including SQL queries, data aggregation, and business insights derived from sales data across country, state, and time dimensions.
